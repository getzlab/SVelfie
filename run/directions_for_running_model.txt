This is the set of directions necessary to run SVelfie (equivalent of SSVGAR [previous name for SVelfie] v14):



##### SETUP

1. There is a docker image which can be used to run SVelfie. Please ensure you have docker installed on your machine and run the command 
   "docker run -it xloinaz/ssvgar:v14 /bin/bash".

   (As a side note and for documentation purposes, this docker repository was created by running the commands below from this current directory 
   [using the Dockerfile in this directory]:
   """
   docker build --no-cache -t xloinaz/ssvgar:v14 .
   docker push xloinaz/ssvgar:v14
   """
   But there's no need to run these commands yourself!)

2. Detach from your interactive docker session by pressing ctrl+p followed by ctrl+q from within the session. Then you want to copy your cohort 
   SV list you want to input to SVelfie (see manuscript for specifications on appropriate file format) into the running docker container. In order 
   to do this, you can first find which container you just detached from by running "docker ps". Its container ID will be listed under the 
   "CONTAINER ID" column. Then, you want to run the command "docker cp <path_to_your_cohort_SV_list_file> <container_id>:<your_choice_of_directory_within_the_container>".

   For example, if I want to copy my cohort SV list file "xavis_SV_list.tsv" to my running SVelfie docker container with container ID "bd7ffabb6c9b"
   in the directory "/SSVGAR" from the same directory the file is located in, I would run the command "docker cp xavis_SV_list.tsv bd7ffabb6c9b:/SSVGAR".

3. Run the command "docker attach <container_id>", and then within the docker container run "cd /SSVGAR/run_v14" to navigate into the appropriate 
   directory from which we would like to run SVelfie. 



##### ACTUALLY RUNNING SVELFIE (AND DOWNSTREAM ANALYSES/VISUALIZATIONS)

4. It's time to actually run SVelfie. Please run the command "python run_SVelfie.py --cohort <cohort_you_want_to_run_on> --SV_list_path <path_to_your_cohort_SV_list_file>"
   where <cohort_you_want_to_run_on> is the name of the cohort for which you're running SVelfie (any name is OK — choose it to be whatever you want) 
   and <path_to_your_cohort_SV_list_file> is the path (relative or absolute) to the SV list file you want to use (that you copied in from step 2). 
   Your <cohort_you_want_to_run_on> should map to a specific <path_to_your_cohort_SV_list_file> and vice versa. You can also specify SVelfie's 
   windowing parameter by specifying an integer value for the "--distance_threshold" option which you can add to the command as well. The results of
   your run once finished can be found in the directory ../model_results relative to this directory within a folder of the name <cohort_you_want_to_run_on>.

5. It's time to run multiple test correction to produce SVelfie's final SV hit list, as well as add auxiliary informational columns about such putative
   hits. Please run the command "python evaluate_results_for_LOF_analysis_just_LOF_model.py --cohort <cohort_you_want_to_run_on> --min_num_patients_with_SV_for_gene_cutoff_for_FDR <minimum_num_of_patients_with_correponding_SV_to_gene_to_be_used_for_FDR>" 
   where <cohort_you_want_to_run_on> is the same name of the cohort for which you ran SVelfie in step 4 and <minimum_num_of_patients_with_correponding_SV_to_gene_to_be_used_for_FDR>
   is the minimum number of patients which must have an SV corresponding to a gene for that gene to be considered for our multiple test correction. The 
   default for this value is 5. You can also specify the same windowing parameter you used for step 4 by specifying an integer value for the "--distance_threshold" 
   option, which you can add to the command as well. The results of running this can also be found in the directory ../model_results/<cohort_you_want_to_run_on> 
   relative to this directory, where there will be a file which includes the FDR correction with additional auxiliary informational columns of the 
   results, as well as a similar file that is filtered for hits with a q-value less than 0.25.

6. You can produce QQ plots corresponding to the results from steps 4 and step 5. Please run the command "python produce_QQ_plot_for_LOF_analysis.py 
   --cohort <cohort_you_want_to_run_on> --min_num_patients_with_SV_for_gene_cutoff_for_FDR <minimum_num_of_patients_with_correponding_SV_to_gene_to_be_used_for_FDR>" 
   where <cohort_you_want_to_run_on> is the same name of the cohort for which you ran SVelfie in steps 4 and 5. You should use the same value for the 
   "--min_num_patients_with_SV_for_gene_cutoff_for_FDR" option that you used in step 5. You should also use the same windowing parameter you used in 
   steps 4 and 5 by specifying an integer value for the "--distance_threshold" option if you manually set this parameter for steps 4 and 5. You can 
   also specify a y-axis cutoff for the QQ plots by specifying a number for the "--neg_log10_cutoff_for_plot" option — this is the number that would 
   be the -log10 of the observed p-values. Additionally, you can run p-mid adjustment by adding in the "--use_p_mid" option. The results for running 
   this script can be found in the directory ../model_results/<cohort_you_want_to_run_on> relative to this directory, where there within that directory 
   there will be a "QQ_plots" folder with the results. 

7. To produce CoMut-like plots from the results of running SVelfie (which show LoF and non-LoF SVs for certain genes), run "python generate_SV_CoMut_like_plot_based_off_LoF_significance_model_results.py 
   --cohort <cohort_you_want_to_run_on> --min_num_patients_with_SV_for_gene_cutoff_for_FDR <minimum_num_of_patients_with_correponding_SV_to_gene_to_be_used_for_FDR>"
   from the run directory. You should use the <cohort_you_want_to_run_on> from steps 4, 5, and 6 and the <minimum_num_of_patients_with_correponding_SV_to_gene_to_be_used_for_FDR>
   value from steps 5 and 6. If you anually specified a windowing parameter for steps 4, 5, and 6, you should use that with the "--distance_threshold" 
   option. The results for running this script can be found in the directory ../model_results/<cohort_you_want_to_run_on> relative to this directory, 
   where there within that directory there will be a "CoMut_like_plots" folder with the results.


# TODO: Need to include steps to produce Circos plots for genes as well as to include an efficient power analysis as appropriate. Also would be nice to 
#       include plots showing the distributions of breakpoints.

# TODO: Need to incorporate RNA-seq data as appropriate. Some cohorts do not have RNA-seq data and it's weird accounting for each cohort, though.
